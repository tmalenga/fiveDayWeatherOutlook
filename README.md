# fiveDayWeatherOutlook
## Description

Using an the weathermap API, as part of the course requirements for the UNB Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp, I have created a weather app/ "Weather Daashboard".
This allows the user to input any City, and the app will return (from data extracted from the Weathermap API) the current weather and the 5 day weather forcast. Previous searched will be saved to local storage, with the last 5 Cities being displayed on the screen.
